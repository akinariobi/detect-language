*** only for python3+ ***

This is a program which takes your str and returns a language of this.

Does not works with short texts.

Uses the global list of most common words in every language.

UPD// I'll try to make v2 with dict which uses a dict and compare this global_dict with input (+ modifications for chinese, russian, etc.)

You can find text reference in folder "documents".
